# 🌟 RISC-V SoC Tapeout – Week-5: OpenROAD Flow installation, Environmental Setup, and Execution of Floor-plan and Placement Stages.

## 🎯 Overview

Welcome to **Week 5** of the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program, where we transition from transistor-level circuit design to the backend physical implementation flow using **OpenROAD** — a fully automated, open-source RTL-to-GDSII system for digital IC design.

This week focuses on:
- 🔨 Installing and validating the OpenROAD Flow Scripts (ORFS) environment
- 📐 Running the **Floorplan** and **Placement** stages of the design flow
- 🔄 Understanding how logical netlists are transformed into physical layouts
- 🐛 Troubleshooting build and dependency errors effectively

---

## 🌟 Learning Journey

This marks your transition from device-level simulation (Week 4) to physical realization on silicon, where logic gates are translated into geometric layouts. After mastering SPICE-level CMOS behavior, you now see how those circuits are placed and arranged physically to form complete chips.

### 📖 What You'll Understand

✅ How core area and die dimensions are defined during floorplanning  
✅ How standard cells are automatically placed to optimize area and timing  
✅ How OpenROAD automates complex backend stages in chip design  
✅ The complete RTL-to-GDSII flow automation process  

---

## 🔍 OpenROAD Overview

OpenROAD automates all backend stages of VLSI physical design, including:

➡️ **Logic Synthesis**  
➡️ **Floorplanning**  
➡️ **Placement**  
➡️ **Clock-Tree Synthesis (CTS)**  
➡️ **Routing**  
➡️ **Final GDSII Layout Generation**

### 🛠️ Key Components

- **OpenROAD** → Full RTL-to-GDS flow automation
- **Yosys** → Logic synthesis integration
- **OpenSTA** → Static timing verification
- **TritonTools** → Floorplan, placement, CTS, and routing
- **Sky130/Nangate45 PDK** → Physical library support

---

## 💻 Installation Steps

### 📥 Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts
cd OpenROAD-flow-scripts/
```

> 📌 **Note:** The `--recursive` flag ensures all submodules are initialized properly.

---

### 🔧 Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh
```

This installs all necessary dependencies and prepares the environment for compilation, including:

✅ `build-essential`, `cmake`, `tcl`  
✅ `libx11-dev`, `libxrender1`, `libxext6`  
✅ `yosys`, `magic`, `netgen`, and other EDA tools  

> ⚠️ **Important:** Verify gcc, g++, and make versions for build compatibility.

---

### 🏗️ Step 3: Build OpenROAD

```bash
./build_openroad.sh --local
```

This command compiles OpenROAD from source and installs the required flow binaries locally.

#### 📊 Expected Output:
The build process will compile various modules and may take 15-30 minutes depending on your system.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Build Issues

### ⚠️ Common Error: Build Halts at ~67%

During the build process, the compilation may stop around **67%** due to conflicting CMake test targets or GPU definitions.

#### 🔧 Solution: Modify CMakeLists.txt

**1️⃣ Navigate to the OpenROAD source directory:**

```bash
cd ~/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/tools/OpenROAD
```

**2️⃣ Open and edit CMakeLists.txt:**

```bash
nano CMakeLists.txt
```

**3️⃣ Replace the file contents with this patched version:**

```

**4️⃣ Save and exit:**
- Press `Ctrl + O`, then `Enter` to save
- Press `Ctrl + X` to exit

**5️⃣ Return to main directory and rebuild:**

```bash
cd ~/OpenROAD-flow-scripts
./build_openroad.sh --local
```

### ✅ What This Fix Achieves:

- ✔️ Proper handling of GCC/Clang versions
- ✔️ Disables test builds that cause conflicts
- ✔️ Avoidance of Qt and test-related build issues
- ✔️ Ensures GPU flags are properly handled
- ✔️ Links `stdc++fs` for older GCC versions (< 9.1)
- ✔️ Successful local build of OpenROAD binaries

### 🐛 Additional Common Errors:

**❌ Missing `spdlog` dependency:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install libspdlog-dev
```

**❌ Missing `gtest` (Google Test):**
```bash
sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev
```

**❌ Missing build.log file:**
- Ensure you're in the correct directory
- Check write permissions

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

### 🔍 Step 4: Verify Installation

```bash
source ./env.sh
yosys -help
openroad -help
```

**Expected Output:**  
Both `yosys` and `openroad` should respond successfully with their help documentation — this confirms a valid installation.

You can also check the version:

```bash
./build/src/openroad --version
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Flow

### 📐 Step 5: Execute Floorplan and Placement

```bash
cd flow/
make
```

This runs the flow using built-in example designs (such as `gcd` with the Nangate45 PDK).

**📊 What This Does:**
- Executes synthesis using Yosys
- Performs floorplanning
- Runs placement optimization
- Generates timing reports

---

### 🖼️ Step 6: Visualize the Layout

```bash
make gui_final
```

This opens the **OpenROAD GUI** showing the final placement and floorplan visualization.

**✅ You should now see:**
- The core area and standard cell placement
- Die boundaries and core regions
- Timing and slack charts within the OpenROAD GUI
- Visual representation of how cells are arranged
